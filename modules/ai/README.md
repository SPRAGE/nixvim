# AI Module ðŸ¤–
The AI module supercharges your Neovim setup by integrating powerful AI assistants directly into your workflow. It features both GitHub Copilot for real-time code completion and Copilot Chat for interactive conversations, code analysis, test generation, and more.
It's pre-configured to be seamlessly integrated with your environment, boosting your productivity from the moment you enable it.
Features ðŸŒŸ
 * AI-Powered Completion: Get real-time, context-aware code suggestions from GitHub Copilot.
 * Interactive AI Chat: Open a chat panel to ask questions, refactor code, or brainstorm ideas with Copilot Chat.
 * Contextual Code Actions: Explain, review, or generate tests and documentation for your code in normal or visual mode.
 * Model Selection: Easily switch between different AI models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) to balance speed and capability.
 * Fully Integrated: Works out-of-the-box with a rich set of pre-configured keymaps.
 * CMP Integration: Accept ghost-text suggestions with a simple keystroke.
